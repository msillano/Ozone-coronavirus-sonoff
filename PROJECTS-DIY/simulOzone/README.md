The concentration of ozone in a given volume depends on two factors: ozone generation and ozone self-recombination.

Since there are a production and a consumption mechanism at the same time, the ozone concentra­tion tends to an equilibrium value that cannot be overcome. In other words, for each combination of genera­tor/environment, there is a limit to the maximum concentration that can be obtained, even keeping the generator ON for very long times.

This constitutes the problem: the concentration is defined by differential equations and follows an exponential trend, therefore it is a non-linear quantity and cannot be evaluated with simple mathe­matical operations.

But it can be calculated with appropriate tools! This is the motivation that pushed me to create ***SimulOzone, an ozone concentration simulator.***
